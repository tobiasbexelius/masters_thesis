Suppose that one needs to know the dimensions of a package, but does not have a measuring tool.
What most people do have is a smartphone, which has the potential to be a measuring tool.
If a reference object of known size is placed on top of the package, and the two objects are filmed together, the dimensions of the package can be calculated.

This report presents a method to measure the dimensions of cuboid packages without any user intervention.
The reference object and package are automatically detected, and the position of their positions given to a measuring algorithm.
Camera calibration can be avoided by using the vanishing points which are generated by the edges of the package.

With this method, a correct measurement was achieved in $92\%$ of the images when a subset of the tested camera poses were used. On the complete test set the success rate was $51\%$.
Online testing on a smartphone shows that the detection algorithm is not yet mature to be run in a real-time application, but could work well in a non-real time application.

%The purpose of the presented measuring solution is to be used on a mobile device.
%
%The purpose of the algorithm is to be run in an application on a mobile device, and hence, it was designed with was designed with the consequent processing time constraints in mind.
%
%A version of the algorithm which used calibrated views were also implemented, to determine how much performance needed to be sacrificed to gain the convenience of not having to go through the calibration procedure.
%The success rates when testing the measuring algorithm in isolation was $81\%$ for uncalibrated views, and $93\%$ for calibrated views.
