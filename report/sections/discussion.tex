\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Future Work}
% Infinite possibilities
% Improve detection robustness & speed
% Object tracking
% Use multiple images
% Use no reference object, e.g. take one snapshot, move 1 meter in some direction without otherwise moving camera, take another. Use phone sensors to detect and estimate error.


\section{Sources of error}
% when taking pictures from 2 side persepective it is very important to stand in the middle, otherwise one side will appear as a straight line and its corner will therefore not be detected

\section{Conslusions}

% Very difficult to make general detection based on this simple approach
% Earlier testing, adaptive thresholding
% App can use a sequence of snapshots, then process all, then output result. should take not take long on s6



% demo app not pleasant to use in its current state, but it could be if tracking is added, or with a non-realtime solution

% only 1 room was used, not the easiest environment through
